Bird b;  <----------------

3) Correct Statement

Figure out the correct statement
class Car{
    public : 
    int price;
};

int main() {
    Car c; 
    //Figure out the correct statement to set the price of the car object referred to by c to “10000”
}

Options

c->price = 10000
Car.price = 10000
c.price = 10000;    <-------------

Options

What will be the output of the following program ?
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape{
    public : 
    int height;
    int width;
};

int main() {
    Shape *s = new Shape();
    s -> height = 1;
    cout << s -> height;
}

Options
Error
0
1    <------------
GarbageValue


6) False statement

Which statement is not true in C++ language ?

Options
A public member of a class can be accessed outside the class.
A private member of a class cannot be accessed by the functions of the same class.  <---------------- 
A private member of a class cannot be accessed outside the same class.
None of the above


7) What is the output

What will be the Output ?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Box{
    public :
    int width;
    int height;
    int length;
    void volume(){
        cout << length * width * height;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box b;
    b.height = 5;
    b.width = 4;
    b.volume();
}

Options
Error
0
20
Garbage value <-------------

Solution Description
####Height and width are initialised to 5 and 4 respectively but length is not initialised. Default value for an integer data member of a class is garbage value, hence length contains garbage value. Volume will thus be garbage value.


8) What is the output

What will be the output of the following code ?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student{
    public :
    char *name;
    int rollNo;
    Student(int num){
        rollNo = num;
    }

    void print(){
        cout << rollNo;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s(12);
    s.print();
}

Answer
12

Solution Description
####Constructor is called when an object is created, here when we create a Student object, corresponding student object is created and rollNo is assigned to 12. So output is 12.



9) What is the output

What will be the output of the following code ?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student{
    public :
    char name;
    int rollNo;

    Student(int num){
        rollNo = num;
    }

    void print(){
        cout << name << " "  <<  rollNo;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student *s = new Student();
    s -> name = 'A';
    s -> rollNo = 15;
    s -> print();
}

Options
GarbageValue 0
GarbageValue 15
Compilation Error  <--------------

Solution Description
####There is Compilation error - “constructor Student() is undefined” because the default constructor is available only till the point we don’t create our own constructor. So Student class has only one constructor which require roll number as argument, hence we should pass integer as argument while creating any Student object.


10) Which of the following statements are not true about destructor?
1. It is invoked when object goes out of the scope
2. Like constructor, it can also have parameters 
3. It can be declared in private section
4. It bears same name as that of the class and precedes tilde sign. 

Options
Only 2, 4
Only 2, 3
Only 1, 3
Only 1, 4
Only 2   <--------------


11) Copy Constructor

Assume class DEMO. Which of the following statement(s) responsible to invoke copy constructor?
1. DEMO D2(D1); //  Here D1 is an already created object of class  DEMO
2. D2 = D1; // Here D1, D2 are already created objects of class DEMO

Options
Only 1  <---------------
Only 2
Both 1 and 2


12) Copy Assignment Operator

Consider following piece of code:

class Pair{
  public :
  int first;
  int second;
};

int main(){

  Pair *p1 = new Pair;
  Pair p2;
}
Which of the following statement is feasible ?

Options
1. p2 = p1;
2. p2 = *p1; <-------------
3. Both 1 and 2 are correct.
4. None of the above


13) Copy Assignment Operator

Consider following piece of code:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Pair{
      public :
      int first;
      int second;
};

int main(){

      Pair p1;
      p1.first = 10;
      p1.second = 20;
      Pair p2;
      p2 = p1;
      cout << p2.first << " " << p2.second << endl;
}
What will be the output ?
Options
10 20  <----------------------
Error
Garbage_value Garbage_value
